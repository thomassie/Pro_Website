**Synchronous scrolling** is something quite annoying in Tableau. Whenever one has two or more tables that should behave as one it gets a bit hard to make this happen in an easy way. I was applying a simple parameter/filter approach, but it's still not perfect.

In addition, I was using the first time a layout container's **show/hide button**. It allows one to easily switch between two visualizations. There are various ways of how to make use of this pretty cool feature.

And because I needed data to check out these two functionalities I searched [Open Data Zurich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/) for interesting datasets. What I found was a couple of datasets (one for each year) about the numbers of registered dogs in the city of Zurich (CH). Unified in Tableau this data resulted in the Viz **[Dogs of Zurich](https://public.tableau.com/profile/thomas.massie#!/vizhome/DOGSofZURICH/DOGSofZURICH---Cover)**. You can have a look at on Tableau Public or read more about it in the respective [project](https://thomassie.me/DogsOfZurich/).
