## Building an interactive CV with Tableau

...is a very different experience compared to how you normally use Tableau. Instead of analysing your data according to (sub)categories, taking care of aggregated measures and how to calculate these and so on, you rather try to convert a sketch into a dashboard and build a couple of minimal data files to fill it with content. My idea was to make the dashboard look similar to my [one-pager CV](https://thomassie.me/CV_Summary___Thomas_Massie.pdf). That is, my portrait picture, the timeline, the colours used etc. should all look similar to generate something like a 'corporate identity'.

When you look at the picture above you recognise that I divided the dashboard into four major parts: a portrait picture, my name, my profession and four profile links (1), two lollipop charts reflecting the strength of certain skills and opinions (2), a timeline showing my career from when I started studying biology until my recent employment (3), and, finally, a map depicting a couple of places I was having the chance of visiting in the past (4). Let's quickly go through the different parts:

I used the portrait picture from the CV mentioned above and placed it in the top-left corner.
