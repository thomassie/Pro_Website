Finally, the first part of my analysis/exploration of [storm data](Storms) from the HURDAT2 data set is online. I was about to write 'done', but, actually it's done since a couple of days. However, I wasn't able to embed all figures when exporting R markdown files with R Studio to .md and .html.

It works fine when I use the -.html output and use it as a site here. However, .html files are already rendered and I couldn't use the css formatting that I use throughout my website. I described this issue on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48379530/no-figures-when-md-file-is-used-as-page-with-github-pages). Feel free to contribute if you have a solution.

I have to say however, that I figured out how to get in the figures. The next thing is to find a smart way of including leaflet objects. =)
