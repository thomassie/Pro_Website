In this project I analysed and visualised storms belonging to the revised Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT2). I did this as practice of [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) [for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), which both are wonderful tools to communicate information.
