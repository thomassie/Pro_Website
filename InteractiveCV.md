## Building an interactive CV with Tableau

...is a very different experience compared to how you normally use Tableau. Instead of analysing your data according to (sub)categories, taking care of aggregated measures and how to calculate these and so on, you rather try to convert a sketch into a dashboard and build a couple of minimal data files to fill it with content. My idea was to make the dashboard look similar to my [one-pager CV](https://thomassie.me/CV_Summary___Thomas_Massie.pdf). That is, my portrait picture, the timeline, the colours used etc. should all look similar to generate something like a 'corporate identity'.

When you look at the overview of the dashboard above you may recognise that I divided the dashboard into four major parts: a portrait picture, my name, my profession and four profile links (1), two lollipop charts reflecting the strength of certain skills and opinions (2), a timeline showing my career from when I started studying biology until my recent employment with PwC (3), and, finally, a map depicting a couple of places I had the chance to visit in the past (4). Let's quickly go through the different parts:

#### **1**
I used the portrait picture from the CV mentioned above and placed it in the top-left corner. It's the area your eyes will focus on first.
Next, I was playing around with my name. The fact that three letter in my first and last name overlap (thoMASsie) lead me to the idea of displaying the four parts (THO MAS MAS SIE) by a 2x2 matrix. Using two colours supports reading my name in two different ways: top-down by columns, or left-right by rows.
I was using the two colours also for my profession by training (biologist/ecologist, grey) and by my current scope of work (data analyst/visualiser, blue).
Finally, I included icons of my personal homepage, LinkedIn, Tableau Public and Twitter as well as the links referring to my profiles when clicking on these.

#### **2**
Next, I wanted to provide an overview about my skills and proficiency (left side), and about certain things I (dis)like (right side). I chose lollipop charts because their are lighter than bar charts
