My name is Thomas M. Massie and I am a biologist/ecologist. 
I have a background in theoretical ecology. That is, I am adressing fundamental ecological processes such as (resource) competition, predator-prey interactions, synchrony among and within populations and so on. These processes influences the dynamic bahaviour of single individuals, populations, and, of course, entire communities since no species is isolated from others within an ecosystem.  

At the same time I am also an experimental ecologist that enjoys designing and performing experiments that yield accurate and reproducable data. This can be quite challenging when it comes to 

After 4.5 years working as a postdoc at the University of Zurich, I recently decided to stop my scientific career, take a personal sabbatical and start a new chapter b working in...

### ...Data Science & Information Design
I always loved to search my data for patterns that surprise me. Do not get me wrong! It is great to confirm theory and models by empirical findings. However, surpises are inevitable and very important. 

### ...Nature Conservation


### ...Education


I am skilled in analysing data from various sources. Mostly, data was provided by experiments which provide large data sets and reflect complex interactions
