Another way of exploring the HURDAT2 data set is employing [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com), a pretty nice software for analysis and visualisation of data.

I am not an expert, but it took me only 5 minutes to build my first graphs. Minor issues popped up, however, when Tableau read in numeric columns from the .csv file that contained NAs. The result is that Tableau changes the data type to characters. But you can easily change the data type and tell Tableau to forget about NAs.

I will definitely continue analysing data with R. But from time to time I will switch to Tableau to generate dashboards or just explore the data. It is fun!

Have a look at the maps and graphs that I have done with Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/CFX2YRXX4?:display_count=yes). (Unfortunately, in the online version animations are not possible as far as I know. You only get screenshots to click through...)
