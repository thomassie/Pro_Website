My name is Thomas M. Massie and I am a biologist / ecologist.

I have a background in theoretical ecology. That is, I am adressing fundamental ecological processes such as (resource) competition, predator-prey interactions, synchrony among and within populations and so on. These processes influences the dynamic bahaviour of single individuals, populations, and, of course, entire communities since no species is isolated from others within an ecosystem.  

At the same time I am also an experimental ecologist. I really enhoy designing and performing experiments that yield accurate and reproducable data – which can be quite challenging when it comes to keeping away any disturbing influences that may lead to additional, unwanted 'noise'. Hence, it is absolutely worth choosing an experimental system that delivers data to adequately inform your models. Because, your analysis, the insights you infer from these, as well as the forecasts you make can be only as good as the data you work with. 

After 4.5 years working as a postdoc at the University of Zurich, I recently decided to stop my academic career to take a personal sabbatical and start a new chapter by working in...


### ...Data Science & Information Design

I love to search data for patterns that surprise me. Do not get me wrong! It is great when data confirms what you already know or expect. However, surprises are inevitable and very important. And also: fun. I mean, if you could decide whether to go with something simple, straighforward and expectable, or, you could choose something novel, challenging and unexpected... Well, I guess you get what I am saying. (That being said, getting no confirmation at all is pretty frustrating...)

It is these surpising elements that make them also challenging when it comes to communication. Because what you already know is easy to understand, often by intuition. But unknown facts and patterns are far more complicated being made accessible to your mind. And that is where good communication comes into play. 

I belive that information, even of the highly complex kind, can be communicated to (almost) any audience. But therefore you have to know your audience and be aware of available communication tools. And, maybe not that easy for scientists, you have to do the splits between accurately reflecting data and facts, and the degree of simplification that is necessary to make them graspable for your audience. A challenge, but a very cool one! 


### ...Nature Conservation

Well, biology and nature conservation have always been and still are at the core of all my activities. I draw my motivation form the idea of contributing in whatever way to the preservation of our environment and a sustainable way of living.


### ...Education

I love explaining nature – its organimsms, patterns, interactions and so on – to kids and grown-ups likewise. Telling people about what is right in front of their noses and showing 
When you see that they enjoy it, you know that they will 

That is one of the most rewarding things you can experience. This and the fact that you can change things to the better is why I would love being involved in any kind of education projects.
