Finally, it's done: Besides the website cumulating my photographical work ([thomasmmassie.com](thomasmmassie.com)), I now launched a site that deals with my person and the things that I do and that I am interested in. You will find some info about myself, a brief CV and a couple of projects that I was, am, and will be working on. Especially latter will be filled more and more during the next days, weeks and months.  
Moreover, the blog section is also intended to reflect my opinions about current affairs.
