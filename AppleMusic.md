The global CoViD-19 dashboard allows you to gain an overview and easily track case numbers. You can have a look at the dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/thomas.massie#!/vizhome/Covid-19---VIZ/Dashboard) or watch the video on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/426998521).<br/><br/>
