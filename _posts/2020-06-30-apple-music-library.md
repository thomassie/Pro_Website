Recently, I was wondering about **which are the songs I listen to most often on Apple Music**. Sure, [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/chde/music/) can show you the "Top 25 Most Played" songs. However, it didn’t provide me with the instant overview I wanted to have. And it’s not made for **conditional filtering**.

So, I exported the library, read and processed the `.xml?` file in **R**, created an excerpt, and visualised this sample in **Tableau**. Well, that worked quite nicely… You can have a look at [the result](https://public.tableau.com/profile/thomas.massie#!/vizhome/AppleMusicLibrary/APPLEMUSICMEDIATHEK) on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/).

In case you want to use this dashboard to apply it to your very own music library, just [follow these steps](https://thomassie.me/AppleMusic/)!
