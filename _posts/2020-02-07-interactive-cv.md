Recently, I managed to design my very own interactive CV with Tableau and published it on Tableau Public. I wanted to do this since a couple of months, but couldn't find the time. Well, now it's done and you can have a look at it [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/thomas.massie#!/vizhome/InteractiveCV_15787566775570/CV). And don't worry, it also works on your mobile phone. =)

If you'd like to find out more about how I designed it (data, sections, arrangement...) you might have a look at the respective [project]().
