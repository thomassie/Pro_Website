My name is Thomas M. Massie and I am a biologist / ecologist. 
I have a background in theoretical ecology. That is, I am adressing fundamental ecological processes such as (resource) competition, predator-prey interactions, synchrony among and within populations and so on. These processes influences the dynamic bahaviour of single individuals, populations, and, of course, entire communities since no species is isolated from others within an ecosystem.  

At the same time I am also an experimental ecologist that enjoys designing and performing experiments that yield accurate and reproducable data. This can be quite challenging when it comes to 

After 4.5 years working as a postdoc at the University of Zurich, I recently decided to stop my scientific career, take a personal sabbatical and start a new chapter by working in...

### ...Data Science & Information Design
I love to search data for patterns that surprise me. Do not get me wrong! It is great when data confirms what you already know or expect. However, surprises are inevitable and very important. And also: fun. I mean, if you could decide whether to go with something simple, straighforward and expectable, or, you could choose something novel, challenging and unexpected... Well, I guess you get what I am saying. (That being said, getting no confirmation at all is pretty frustrating...)

It is these surpising elements that make them also challenging being communicated. Because what you already know is easy to understand, often by intuition. But unknown facts and patterns are far more complicated being made accessible to your brain. And that is where good communication comes into play. Your findings are 

I am skilled in analysing data from various sources. Mostly, data was provided by experiments which provide large data sets and reflect complex interactions
