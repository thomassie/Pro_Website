Finally, it's done: Besides the website cumulating my photographical work ([thomasmmassie.com](thomasmmassie.com)), I now launched a site that deals with my person and the things that I do and that I am interested in. You will find some info about myself, a brief CV and a couple of projects that I was, am, and will be working on.

These are also more or less the topics that I will blog about. However, the blog section is also intended to reflect my opinions about current affairs.

Have fun!
