The [next part](http://thomassie.de/StormDataExploration_2.html) of my HURDAT2 data exploration is online. The leaflet objects could not be exported to an .md file for use with GitHub pages. Hence, I simply added the .html file. Though lacking the nice formatting, everything else works nicely... =)
